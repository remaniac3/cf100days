            <p>
                As the night grew darker, Coffy and her bandmates, Tea, Yin Yong, Mi and Michael were deeply engrossed in their music practice. The air was filled with the sound of drums, guitars, and Mi's enchanting voice. The school festival was just a few days away, and they wanted to make sure that their performance would be perfect.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, something strange happened that night. Suddenly, the room was filled with a blinding light, and before they knew it, Coffy and her bandmates, together with hundreds of other students and teachers, found themselves in a world that appeared to be a dilapidated mirror image of their own.
            </p>

            <p>
                At first, the students were terrified, unsure of what had just happened. But as they began to explore this new world, they realized that it was safe, with plants overgrowing wild and floods transforming the streets into rivers.
            </p>


            <p>
                Determined to survive and find a way back home, Coffy suggested they host a music festival. Music had always been their passion, and she believed it would boost their spirits and give everyone stranded there the will to persevere. With newfound hope, they set out to plan the festival, all the while wondering how they ended up in this mysterious world and if they would ever find their way back home.

                    <p id="nameColour"><b>Leader, Guitarist</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Passionate for music and fashion, Coffy loves to express herself through her unique style. A fan of Harajuku fashion, she uses lots of accessories to decorate her high school uniform. Despite not being the brightest student, Coffy is hardworking and determined to achieve her dreams. Her upbeat and positive attitude makes her a joy to be around, and she motivates those around her with her personality.

                    <p>
                        Unlike Coffy, Tea is intelligent and resourceful, using his abilities to get the band and now, his school colony, out of tough situations. His compositions are often complex and layered, incorporating a wide variety of instruments. Tea often serves as the voice of reason and the one who helps to keep everyone alive when Coffy's impulsiveness gets the better of her.

                    <p>
                        Mi is known for her incredible singing abilities. Despite her talent, she is quiet and timid in her day-to-day life, often fading into the background and avoiding attention. However, when she begins to sing, her personality changes, and she becomes confident and powerful, commanding attention with her stunning voice. Despite her reserved nature, Mi has a secret love for pandas. Her love for the gentle creatures serves as a source of comfort and inspiration for her, and she often incorporates panda-related imagery into her costume and any personalised visuals.

                    <p>
                        Yin Yong is the flamboyant and attention-seeking bassist of the band, known for his love of showmanship and his distinctive long silky brown hair, which he takes great pride in. He is a talented musician and often takes every opportunity to show off his skills on stage, commanding attention with his confident and charismatic stage presence.

                    <p>
                        Michael is mysterious and does not talk much, always appearing in a panda mascot suit. He secretly admires Mi, but his introverted nature makes it hard to express his feelings. Michael's passion and talent shine through when he is behind the drum kit, although his reserved personality sometimes gives the impression to other members that he is not invested in the band.
