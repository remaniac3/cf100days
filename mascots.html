                    <p>
                        Coffy, a small-town girl with dreams of becoming a star, arrived in the city only to face rejection from movie directors due to her clumsy acting. She eventually accepted an invitation from her cousin, Tea, who owns CF Theatre, a struggling establishment in need of new talent. Even though her acting was rough, her infectious optimism shined through and managed to win the hearts of the audience. She faces bullying from Mi, her respected senpai, but finds a mentor in Yin Yong, who trains her in traditional acting and singing techniques. Inspired by Coffy, Tea wrote a new show with her as the lead, resulting in a modest success that changed the trajectory of CF Theatre.

                    <p>
                        Coffy is enthusiastic, clumsy, and endearing, believing that only by working together can the members of CF Theatre bring out the best in their shows.

                        That being said, as time went by, the audiences now preferred the cinema down the road. Despite trying his best to adjust his shows based on the current trends, sales remained stagnant. With the relevancy of theatre being threatened by moving pictures, Tea has to tirelessly to save the theatre, hiding his struggles behind a weary smile.

                    <p>
                        Now, he faces a final challenge: create one last sellout show or say goodbye to CF Theatre forever.

                        Initially apathetic by her choice of career, she became inspired to improve her performance after witnessing Tea's dedication and feeling a rivalry with Coffy. Now, she's determined to prove her critics wrong.
