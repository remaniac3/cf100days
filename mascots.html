            <p>It has been decades since The Great War. In their victory, the immortal <b>Bunian</b> have used their control over sihir to reshape the world of <b>Nusara</b> into an ecological paradise. The <b>Hewani</b>, a collection of beast-like sentient races shaped by sihir, now live in sparse colonies across the <b>Bunian</b> civilization, their once-celebrated diversities now reduced to whichever use their <b>Bunian</b> rulers deem valuable. It is an unstable peace, and revolution is brewing.</p>

                        A digital artist and Tea's older sister, Coffy was accidentally summoned into the <b><i>Bunian</i></b> capital of <b><i>Aretamus</i></b> by Mi when Tea stepped out of the way to allow her through her door.<br>Now blessed with a magical pen that allows her to turn whatever she draws into reality, Coffy struggles to find a balance between her creative anxieties for character creation and the constant deadlines that (literal) battles demand as she answers the question every isekai protagonist asks - Why, Mi?

                    <p>
                        A mechanical genius and Coffy's loving younger brother. When Coffy disappeared from their shared apartment one day, he invented his way into <b><i>Nusara</i></b> to find her. Unfortunately for him, landing in the <b><i>Hewani</i></b> colony of <b><i>Galak</i></b> was not helpful; his lack of furs or claws had him mistaken for a <b><i>Bunian</i></b> at first, and it would eventually take an intervention form its panda-born ruler (and several innovative wood-tech solutions) before he was finally accepted. He has since started traveling <b><i>Nusara</i></b> with the <b><i>Hewani</i></b>, hiding his face behind a mask and helping them wherever he can, hoping to find Coffy before the impending revolution begins.

                    <p>
                        To many within the <b><i>Bunian</i></b> empire, Mi is the perfect princess. Her crystal-blue hair and affinity for dance has made Mi an icon of <b><i>Bunian</i></b> culture, a point of pride even to her cousin, YinYong. Unbeknownst to most, Mi is a supporter of the <b><i>Hewani</i></b> revolution. Using her sihir, Mi sought to summon a champion to help her, but when the spell revealed the image of the handsome Tea, the love-struck Mi was distracted enough to make the mistake of summoning Coffy instead. Now, stuck with the pink-haired artist from another world, Mi has to try and figure out how one princess and one anxious summoner is to save her world from war.

                    <p>
                        As the current reigning ruler of the <b><i>Bunian</i></b> empire, YinYong has overseen his first decade on the throne in an almost carefree manner. However, beneath his gleeful façade lies the orthodox heart of <b><i>Bunian</i></b> royalty; To him, his race's ability to naturally manipulate sihir to mold the natural world is proof of <b><i>Bunian</i></b> superiority and its place at the top of <b><i>Nusaran</i></b> society. In contrast, <b><i>the Hewani</i></b> need to build from lumber is an abomination to the proud king. He sees news of a growing <b><i>Hewani</i></b> revolution as an insult to the freedoms and prosperity that the <b><i>Bunian</i></b> has brought them, and it would be his place to defend the beauty and pristine civilization his people have built.

                    <p id="mascotMichael"><b>The Wise Sultan of Galak</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Rescued as a cub by a blue-haired <b><i>Bunian</i></b>, Michael never truly carried the hatred most <b><i>Hewani</i></b> had for their oppressors. Instead, the resourceful panda-born was always more focused on the welfare and future of his people. Through his innovative use of the <i>sihir</i>-resistant <b><i>Meranti</i></b>, the tapir-riding Michael has created a new future for his people within the colony of <b><i>Galak</i></b>. In return, his people have crowned him the Shadow Sultan, the symbolic center of the <b><i>Hewani</i></b> revolution. It was a position that he took up reluctantly, so when the capable Tea appeared one day, Michael convinced the green-haired genius to help his people in hopes that Tea would be able to free him of his role and allow him to return his place of birth once more and thank the <b><i>Bunian</i></b> that saved him so many years ago.
