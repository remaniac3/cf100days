            <p>
                It has been decades since The Great War. In their victory, the immortal <b>Bunian</b> have used their control over <i>sihir</i> to reshape the world of <b>Nusara</b> into an ecological paradise. The <b>Hewani</b>, a collection of beast-like sentient races shaped by <i>sihir</i>, now live in sparse colonies across the <b>Bunian</b> civilization, their once-celebrated diversities now reduced to whichever use their <b>Bunian</b> rulers deem valuable. It is an unstable peace, and revolution is brewing.

                    <p>
                        A digital artist and Tea's older sister, Coffy was accidentally summoned into the <b><i>Bunian</i></b> capital of <b><i>Aretamus</i></b> by Mi who was trying to summon Tea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hailed as a mistake, but forced to cooperate, she was blessed with a magical pen forged from <b><i>Bunian</i></b> sihir that allows her to turn whatever she draws into life and was promised a safe passage home if she fulfils her duty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together with Mi, she must answer the call to restore balance to <b><i>Nusara</i></b>.

                    <p id="mascotTea"><b>The Beastmasked Inventor</b></p>
                    <p>
                        A mechanical genius and Coffy's loving younger brother. When Coffy disappeared, he invented a portal into <b><i>Nusara</i></b> to find her. Unfortunately, landing in the <b><i>Hewani</i></b> colony of <b><i>Galak</i></b> was not helpful as he was mistaken for a <b><i>Bunian</i></b>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b><i>Hewani</i></b> were initially impressed by his otherworldly inventions. Ultimately, the intervention of its panda ruler was what elevated Tea to be accepted as a peer in the inventor colony.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He has since started traversing <b><i>Nusara</i></b> with the <b><i>Hewani</i></b>, hiding his face behind a mask and helping them wherever he can, hoping to find Coffy before the war begins.

                    <p id="mascotMi"><b>The Tsundere Bunian Princess</b></p>
                    <p>
                        To many within the <b><i>Bunian</i></b> empire, Mi is the perfect princess. Her love for dance has made Mi a <b><i>Bunian</i></b> celebrity, a point of pride even to her cousin, YinYong. Unbeknownst to most, Mi is a supporter of the <b><i>Hewani</i></b>. Mi sought to summon a champion to help her. The spell, revealing the handsome Tea, distracted her greatly, causing her to mistakenly summon Coffy instead. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, stuck with the artist from another world, Mi has to try and figure out how one princess and one summoner is to save <b><i>Nusara</i></b> from war.

                    <p>
                        As the current reigning ruler of <b><i>Aretamus</i></b>, YinYong's gleeful fa√ßade has a darker side - the orthodox heart of <b><i>Bunian</i></b> supremacy. To him, <b><i>Bunian</i></b> <i>sihir</i> is proof of their position at the top of <b><i>Nusaran</i></b> society. In contrast, the <b><i>Hewani</i></b> who could not do magic is an abomination to the proud king.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He sees the growing <b><i>Hewani</i></b> revolution as an insult and it would be his place to defend the beauty and pristine civilization his people have built.

                        Rescued as a cub by a blue-haired <b><i>Bunian</i></b>, Michael was always more focused on the welfare and future of the <b><i>Hewani</i></b> - a colony of craftsmen. His people, thankful for his leadership, have crowned him the <i>Shadow Sultan</i>, the symbolic center of the <b><i>Hewani</i></b> revolution. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His true purpose when he met Tea is to be able to journey to <b><i>Aretamus</i></b> to thank Mi for her good deed all those years ago.
